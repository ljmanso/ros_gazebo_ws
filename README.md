# Workshop: Introduction to ROS and Gazebo

This workshop has been initially designed for the [Computer Science Seminars](https://cs.aston.ac.uk/seminars/) at [Aston University](https://www.aston.ac.uk). 
It introduces some basics on how to use [ROS](https://www.ros.org) and [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org) for robotics research and development.
This is intended to serve as a guide to follow up along with the online presentation of the workshop.
Alternatively you could try to follow these steps on your own and play around for some self learning. 
The content of this workshop is based on the [ROS tutorials](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/) as well as the [Gazebo tutorials](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials).
It is heavily recommended to check them out in order to expand the knowledge on the tools beyond what is covered here.

If you run into problems or have any questions you could visit [ROS answers](https://answers.ros.org) or [Gazebo answers](https://answers.gazebosim.org) at any time to find a fast and optimal answer.

## Abstract:

ROS is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behaviour across a wide variety of robotic platforms. Gazebo is a robotics simulator that allows to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. In this workshop, Dr Gutierrez will guide you through a step by step practical session on how to develop robotics software with ROS and how Gazebo can help you test your robotics software so it is ready for the real world once you move it to a real robot.

Given that this is a hands-on seminar, attendants are advised where possible to install ROS2 and Gazebo prior to attending the seminar.

Preferably: Ubuntu (20.04) + ROS Foxy (ros-foxy-desktop) + Gazebo 11

ROS Foxy (desktop package): https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Foxy/Linux-Install-Debians/

Gazebo 11: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu

Alternatively: Ubuntu (18.04/20.04) + ROS Dashing (ros-dashing-desktop) + Gazebo 11

ROS Dashing (desktop pacakge): https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Dashing/Linux-Install-Debians/

Gazebo 11: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu 

**Pre-installed virtual machine (recommended):** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gT7C0TBfkQi0dvYoDceRagPC7X-FIRt_/view?usp=sharing

## Prerequisites:

* You are somehow familiar with GNU/Linux based environments and the bash terminal
* You have basic knowledge of Python  or some other form of object oriented programing langugage
* You have a computer with the required software installed or the provided virtual machine running
